Delete  Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Examples:
Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f

Questions:
- none

Solution 1
Iterate from given node changing each node's value to the next node value. Upon reaching the end delete the last element - assign pointer next of the previous node to None. Runtime O(N)

Implementation


def delete_middle_node(node: Node) -> None:
  node.data = node.next.data
  node.next = node.next.next
